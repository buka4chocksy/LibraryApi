# LibraryApi
A REST Api for adding, deleting, updating and borrowing books from a json db library.

USAGE
Create a folder on your computer and store the files from this repository there.
Be sure you have express installed on your computer, IF NOT; open your terminal, navigate to the program folder you created and run npm install express
I advice you use PostMan for testing the Api (it makes it easy to construct requests and view responses)
Visit https://www.getpostman.com to download.

This program has two JavaScript files, bookApi.js and bookLibrary.js; which makes it easy to understand and debug.
All the routing is done in bookApi.js while bookLibrary.js performs our core logic.

TESTING THE API
On your terminal run node bookApi.js
then use Postman to play around with the Api

Your suggestions are welcomed !
